# FantasyFootballBot
This is the README file for “Fantasy Football Bot.”


This program is essentially an assistant for fantasy football addicts who need assistance in setting up their lineups each week. This program has two modes: a player comparison mode where the user inputs the names of two players and can see a comparison of each player’s projected points, matchup ratings, opponents, and much more! The other mode is a cluster graph mode where the program will output a cluster graph of all the top 50 ranked players in each corresponding position and scoring format that is chosen at the start of the program. This graph is really helpful to see which players are more volatile compared to others and which players are ranked higher per expert consensus rankings.


Please install the following libraries on your computer’s terminal:
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install kmeans
pip3 install scikit-learn


You must also import csv, requests, math, cmu_112_graphics (all done for you already)


There will be 3 folders inside the big folder with a total of 12 csv files in each folder. Please do not touch those files as the program will read names within those files.


Run the program by running the file named “TPFinal.py”
